        <h2>This Italian meatball recipe is very easy to make, and since we skip the messy step of pan-frying the meatballs, it becomes downright simple. Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. Once the meatballs are baked, add them to your favorite prepared tomato sauce and simmer for 1 to 2 hours.</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1lb groud pork mince</li>
            <li>1lb ground beef mince</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried italian herbs</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 1/2 inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
